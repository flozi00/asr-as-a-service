# ASR as a service

This project focuses on providing speech recognition across industries and languages.

The project is being developed on a private basis with support from A\\Ware and Reibke.
Currently I'm focusing on languages used in the German area, but I'm happy about any support for other languages.

With the exception of the audio dataset and training script, all code, used models and datasets are released under open source license.
